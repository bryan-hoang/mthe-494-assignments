  abstract    = {The National Transportation Safety Board ({NTSB}) is providing the following information to urge the Federal Aviation Administration ({FAA}) to take action on the safety recommendations in this report. They are derived from our participation in the ongoing investigations of two fatal accidents under the provisions of Annex 13 of the International Civil Aviation Organization. As the accident investigation authority for the state of design and manufacture of the airplane in these accidents, the {NTSB} has been examining the {US} design certification process used to approve the original design of the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System ({MCAS}) on the Boeing Company (Boeing) 737MAX. We note that, since the {PT} Lion Mentari Airlines (Lion Air) accident on October 29, 2018, Boeing has developed an {MCAS} software update to provide additional layers of protection and is working on updated procedures and training. However, we are concerned that the process used to evaluate the original design needs improvement because that process is still in use to certify current and future aircraft and system designs.},
