  \stepcounter{section}
  \section*{Soles and Openings}
  \begin{parnumbers}
    The soles of a shoe housing a multi-wheel heeling apparatus consists of: a forefoot portion, a heel portion, and an arch portion.

    The heel portion includes a brake operable for slowing.

    A multi-wheel heeling apparatus has two openings: a first opening, and a second opening.

    The first opening is formed in a heel portion of the sole.

    The second opening is formed in at least a portion of the arch portion of the sole adjacent the first opening.
  \end{parnumbers}

  \stepcounter{section}
  \section*{Wheel assemblies}
  \begin{parnumbers}
    The multi-wheel heeling apparatus includes: a first wheel assembly, and a second wheel assembly.

    The first wheel assembly includes: a first wheel, a first axle, and a first mounting structure. The first wheel is mounted on the first axle. The first wheel resides in the first opening. The first axle is tensionly coupled to the first mounting structure. The first mounting structure is removably coupled to the first wheel assembly.

    The second wheel assembly includes: a second wheel, a second axle, and a second mounting structure. The second wheel is mounted on the second axle. The second wheel resides in the second opening. The second axle is tensionly coupled to the second mounting structure. The second mounting structure is removably coupled to the second wheel assembly.

  \section*{Wheels}
  \begin{parnumbers}
    A wheel is made of: a urethane, a plastic, a polymer, a metal, an alloy, a wood, a rubber, or a composite material.

    The material a wheel is made of includes: aluminum, titanium, steel, or a resin.

    The material a wheel is made of must be durable. The material a wheel is made of must provide quiet performance. The material a wheel is made of must provide a “soft” or “cushioning” feel.

    The amount or length of the portion of a wheel that extends below the bottom of the sole must be less than the diameter of the wheel. The amount or length of the portion of a wheel that extends below the bottom of the sole must not be restricted by the diameter of the wheel.

    The diameter of the first wheel is similar to a diameter of the second wheel.
  \end{parnumbers}

  \section*{Applicable Standards}
  \begin{parnumbers}
    A multi-wheel heeling apparatus is governed by all the applicable standards contained in ICS 61.060 (Footwear Including shoelaces).
